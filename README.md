# Interactive particular matter (PM10) prediction map

The goal of this work is to present the project Big Data Showcase – particular matter analytics with Hadoop and Apache Spark which was implemented towards examination of the bachelors course Praxisphase at Frankfurt Univesity of Applied Sciences. The visulization was implemented in R-Studio using the Shiny package and is heavily based on the [Shiny SuperZip Exampe](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html).

## Big Data Showcase: Particular matter analysis with Hadoop and Apache Spark
This project was part of my internship at the company MHP Management und IT-Beratung GmbH. During 14 weeks of development, an application which implements loading data from an API, processing of raw data, data analysis and presentation of the results was created in context of the Apache Hadoop eco system. The topic “particular matter and air quality” was chosen to showcase the three main goals of the project, construction of an ETL process, development of a predictive analytics model and visualization of the results. [Luftdaten.info](http://luftdaten.info) is an open source project of the Open Knowledge Lab Stuttgart which researches air quality and particular matter emission. In this context, the Open Knowledge Lab provides a public API which serves the data to be used in this showcase.
